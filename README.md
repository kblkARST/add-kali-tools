# add-kali-tools-script
## warning! this is stupid and dangerous
### this'll add repos to sources.list & apt installing all kali tools manually with force yes option
I'm just testing my script as a "newbie linux user"
please don't blame me if anything went wrong on your device(s)

#### note: run as root and delete the added repo manually in sources.list before upgrading
