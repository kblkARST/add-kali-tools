# "tools-collection" _that i've been using and to be used_
#### WARNING! this is half-stupid and so I was, I'm just apt installing things like katoolin, except katoolin don't works anymore, katoolin3 neither (at least on my pc). So i built this and added packages that i need

Tested on Lubuntu, might damages other idk<br>
this'll add repos to sources.list & installs packages<br>
I'm a newbie linux user please don't blame me if anything went wrong on your device<br>
any assistance would be so nice!<br>
im just doing my things and shared this to friends around<br>
##### Note:<br>Debian based! Run better on but not limited to Ubuntu derivatives<br> Run as root and chmod +x the script first, delete the added repos manually in /etc/apt/sources.list before upgrading as it will DESTROY YOUR LINUX by colliding identical packages
## Usage:
```
sudo su
git clone https://github.com/kblkARST/tools-collection.git
cd tools-collection
chmod +x install-tools.sh
```

Take your risk and Enjoy!
