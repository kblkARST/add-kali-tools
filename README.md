# tools-collections
#### warning! this is stupid, im just apt installing this like katoolin, except katoolin don't works, at least on my pc. so i built this and added packages that i need
this'll add repos to sources.list & installs packages<br>
I'm a newbie linux user please don't blame me if anything went wrong on your device<br>
im just doing my things and shared this to a friend<br>
##### note: debian only! Run as root and chmod +x the script first, delete the added repo manually in sources.list before upgrading as it will DESTROY YOUR LINUX by colliding identical packages
## Usage:
```
sudo su
git clone https://github.com/kblkARST/tools-collection.git
cd tools-collection
chmod +x install-tools.sh
```

Enjoy!
