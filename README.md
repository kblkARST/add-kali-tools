# "tools-collection" _that i've been using and to be used_
#### WARNING! this is half-stupid and so was I<br>I'm just apt installing things like katoolin, except katoolin don't works anymore, katoolin3 neither (at least on my pc). So i built this and added packages that i need, i just want a linux tools to be available on my select linux distros

**Tested on Lubuntu ethernet connected**, might damage other idk<br>
this'll add repos to sources.list & installs packages<br>
I'm a newbie linux user on learning phase<br> so... something might went wrong on your device (so far so good on my VM tho)<br>
*any assistance and corrections would be nice!*<br>
im just doing studying and shared this to friends around<br>
##### Note:<br>Debian based! Run better on but not limited to Ubuntu derivatives<br> Run as root and chmod +x the script first, **delete the added repos manually** in /etc/apt/sources.list before upgrading as **it will DESTROY YOUR LINUX** by colliding identical packages
## Usage:
```
sudo su
git clone https://github.com/kblkARST/tools-collection.git
cd tools-collection
chmod +x install-tools.sh
./install-tools.sh
```
<br>Take your risk and Enjoy!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
