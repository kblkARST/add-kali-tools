# kblk-tools-collections
#### warning! this is stupid, im just apt installing this like katoolin, except katoolin don't works at leat on my pc, so i built this
### this'll add repos to sources.list & installs packages
I'm a newbie linux user please don't blame me if anything went wrong on your device(s)
#### note: run as root and chmod +x the script, delete the added repo manually in sources.list before upgrading as it will destroy your linux by colliding identical packages
